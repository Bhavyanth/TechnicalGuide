* Upcasting: When reference variable of Parent class refers to an object of 
			Child class, it is known as Upcasting.
			
			Ex: Vehicle v = new Vehicle(); // vehicle reference pointing to a vehicle object
				Car c = new Car();  // car reference pointing to a car object
				
				Vehicle v1 = new Car(); // vehicle reference pointing to a car object

* Downcasting: Casting a reference of Parent class to one of its child class.
