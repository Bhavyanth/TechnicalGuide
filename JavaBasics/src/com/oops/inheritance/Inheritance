* Private members of the superclass are not inherited by the subclass, 
instead they can be accessed indirectly using public methods.

* Member with default access specifier in superclass cannot be inherited by subclass 
in other packages. They can be accessed directly using their names in subclasses 
within the same package as superclass;

* The protected modifier specifies that the member can only be accessed within its 
own package and, in addition, by a subclass of its in another package.

* Constructors are not members of a class. So they are not inherited by a subclass, 
but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.
