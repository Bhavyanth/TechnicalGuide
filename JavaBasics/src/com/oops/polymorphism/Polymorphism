* Upcasting: When reference variable of Parent class refers to an object of 
			Child class, it is known as Upcasting.
			
			Ex: Vehicle v = new Vehicle(); // vehicle reference pointing to a vehicle object
				Car c = new Car();  // car reference pointing to a car object
				
				Vehicle v1 = new Car(); // vehicle reference pointing to a car object
				
	1. By casting, the object is not changed, but it is labeled differently.
	2. Casting of an object of child class to its parent class is called upcasting.
	3. It is done implicitly (automatically)
	4. Upcasting can be done whenever there is an is-a relationship
	
* Downcasting: Casting a reference of Parent class to one of its child class.
		
		To invoke a method that is specific to child class, we need
			1. a reference of that class or
			2. Cast the reference of the Parent to the child class
		
		Ex: Vehicle v = new Car(100,5); // Upcasting
			
			To invoke the child specific method, like getNoOfSeats(),
				Car c = (Car) v;  // Downcasting
				c.getNoOfSeats();
				
		-> Downcasting has to be performed manually.
		-> Done using instanceof to know what type of object it is pointing to
