A class declared as abstract is an abstract class.

If a class contains any abstract method it has to be declared as abstract

Abstract Method: A method in a class that is declared without any implementation.

Abstract class can have attributes and normal methods with implementations along with abstract methods,

Rules:
	1. Abstract class cannot be instantiated.
	2. Abstract class can be subclassed.
	3. When a class inherits an abstract class with abstract methods, it has to provice implementation
		for all the abstract methods to make it a concrete class.
	4. If the subclass does not implement all the abstract methods, then the subclass also needs to be
		declared abstract.
	5. Abstract class can contain non abstract methods also.
	6. If an object need not be created for a class, it can be declared as abstract 
		though it does not have any abstract methods.
