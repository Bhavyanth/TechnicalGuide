* Transaction should be managed 
	-> to increase performance
	-> to maintain the integrity of the stored procedures and
	-> to use distributed transactions

* Transaction control the changes applied to a database
	-> Treast an SQL statement or a group of SQL statements as one logical unit, and if any statement fails, the transaction fails

* To commit the changes applied, invoke the commit() method on connection object as- conn.commit();

* To rollback updates to the database made, invoke the rollback() method on the connection object as- conn.rollback();

ResultSet MetaData:
	The meta information about ResultSet can be obtained using ResultSetMetaData
	This is used to get the column name, total number of columns, column type, table name etc.
	
		Ex: Statement st = connection.createStatement();
			ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("select * from employee");
			ResultSetMetaData rsm = rs.getMetaData(); 
			
		Methods:
				rsm.getColumnCount();
				rsm.getColumnName(1); // based on index
				rs,.getColumnTypeName(1); // based on index
				
* Callable Statement:
	-> CallableStatement interface is used to call the stored procedures and functions.
	-> CallableStatement instance is created using prepareCall() method in Connection interface
	
		Ex: CallableStatement stmt = conn.prepareCall("{call employee_insert(?,?)}");
