* LinkedList element insertion is faster compared to arraylist.
	-> Because ArrayList has to resize itself, as it in index based.
	-> For frequent operations 
	-> LinkedList is faster because of doubly linked list i.e., it has two pointers, one before element and one after element

* LinkedList element deletion is faster compared to arraylist.

* ArrayList search operation is fast compared to the LinkedList search operation.
	as it is index based.
* Since LinkedList uses doubly linked list, it needs double pointer and iterator to search.

* LinkedList has more memory overhead than ArrayList 
	-> Because in ArrayList each index only holds actual object.
	-> In LinkedList each node holds both data and address of next and previous node
