A set is a collection with no duplicate elements.
A HashSet stores elements in a hash table.
HashSet doesn't maintain any insertion order. Uses HashMap internally, allows only one null value
A TreeSet stores elements in a balanced binary tree.
A LinkedHashSet in an ordered hash table.
Allows null value
Internally uses map

HashSet is a data structure that can be used to retrieve objects quickly in a set.
	HashSet is an Unordered collection
	A hash code is used to organize the objects in a HashSet
	HashSet Methods:
		boolean add(Object element)
		void clear()
		boolean contains(Object o)
		boolean isEmpty()
		boolean remove(Object o)
		int size() 
		
TreeSet: 	Provides the properties of a set in an ordered collection.
			Objects can be inserted in any order but are retrieved in a sorted order.
			TreeSet uses Comparable interface to compare objects for sorting.
			Tree map cannot have a null value, but have multiple null values.
			


			Iterator is the parent interface of all collection frameworks
			Collection is an interface
			Implements all methods
