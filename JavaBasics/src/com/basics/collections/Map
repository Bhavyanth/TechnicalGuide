Map are sometimes called associative arrays.

A Map object describes mappings from keys to values:
	Duplicate keys are not allowed.
	One-to-many mappings from keys to values are not permitted
	
The contents of the Map interface can be viewed and manipulated as collections
	entrySet: Returns a set of all key-value pairs
	keySet: Returns a set of all keys in the map
	values: Returns a Collection of all values in the map
	
TreeMap orders the keys
HashMap stores the keys in a hash table
HashMap class is generally preferred for its efficiency unless sorted keys are needed.
